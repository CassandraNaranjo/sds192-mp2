## Loading the data
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

> Word count: `r wordcountaddin::word_count()`

##Filtering out what we want from candidates data.frame
```{r}
new_c <- candidates %>%
  filter(cand_election_yr == "2012") %>%
  select(cand_id,cand_election_yr)
```

##Filtering out what we want from house_elections data.frame and mutating to create a common variable
```{r}
new_h_e <- house_elections %>%
  filter(incumbent == "TRUE") %>%
  mutate(cand_id = fec_id) %>%
  select(cand_id, candidate_name, state, incumbent, party, ge_winner)
```

##BRB attempting to join
```{r}
MP2_table <- new_h_e %>%
  inner_join(new_c, by = c("cand_id" = "cand_id"))
```
